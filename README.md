## Minecraft Server Data Analysis

The project in this repository is a data science project that I made in my Introduction to Data Science course in March 2025. For this project, we were given data collected from a Minecraft server to wrangle and visualize. I used R in Jupyter Notebook to create this data analysis, which includes my exploration of the data through different kinds of visualizations.
